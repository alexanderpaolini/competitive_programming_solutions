# FIU 2024 HSPC

Here are my solutions for the 2024 FIU High School Programming Competition (Novice Division). These are all of the submitted (and correct) solutions that I was able to print out as the competition ended.

Because this competition was in-person, the files are formatted as `filename.py` rather than my standardized `problem/solution.py`.

Place: 1st (Novice Division)
