# Example

This is the example `Hello World` problem. This folder provides an example of the standard format used.

**Files**:

- `solution.py` - The solution to the problem.
- `1.in` / `1.out` - An example passing test case.

The solution can be tested one of _three_ main ways:

1. `python solution.py < 1.in`
2. `python ../helper/main.py --name=. --input = 1.in`
3. Using the VSCode task to test the problem - This method being prefered

> Note: When running the helper script, be sure to be in the parent directory, and not the problem's directory.
